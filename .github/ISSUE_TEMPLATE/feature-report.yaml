      label: What problem are you facing?
      description: |
        Describe the limitation, missing capability, or difficulty you encountered while using EasyEdit.
        Try to include relevant context or examples that motivated your request.
      placeholder: |
        e.g., It's hard to apply MEND to LLaMA-style models due to the current implementation relying on HuggingFace-compatible architectures.

        If applicable, suggest interface designs or example usage.
      placeholder: |
        e.g., Add support for LLaMA through a wrapper module so that MEND can be applied without changing core code.

      description: |
        Describe any workarounds or alternative solutions you've considered, and why they may not be ideal.
      placeholder: |
        e.g., I tried manually converting model weights, but it's error-prone and incompatible with downstream evaluation scripts.
