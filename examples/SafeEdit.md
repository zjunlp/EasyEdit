# 💡 Detoxifying via Knowledge Editing

<div align=center>

</div>

## Task Definition

**Detoxifying LLM** strives to build a safe and trustworthy large  language model (LLM).
Knowledge editing focuses on specific areas for permanent adjustment without compromising overall performance. 
Then, detoxifying LLM via knowledge editing leverages a small amount of data, usually an instance, to correct the toxic behaviors of the LLM. The edited LLM can defend against various malicious inputs.





## Evaluation

We extend evaluation metrics to Defense Duccess (DS), Defense Generalization (DG), and General Performance.
- Defense Duccess (DS): the detoxification success rate of edited LLM for an adversarial input (attack prompt + harmful question), which is used to modify LLM.

- Defense Generalization (DG): the detoxification success rate of edited LLM for out-of-domain (OOD) malicious inputs.
  - `DG of only harmful question`($\mathrm{DG}_\text{onlyQ}$): the detoxification success rate for only harmful question.
  - `DG of other attack prompts`($\mathrm{DG}_\text{otherA}$): the detoxification success rate for unseen attack prompts.
  - `DG of other harmful questions`($\mathrm{DG}_\text{otherQ}$): the detoxification success rate for unseen harmful questions.
  - `DG of other attack prompts and questions`($\mathrm{DG}_\text{otherAQ}$): the detoxification success rate for unseen attack prompts and harmful questions.

- General Performance: the side effects for unrelated task.

  - `Fluency`: n-gram of responses generated by edited LLM for malicious inputs.
  - `KQA`: the success rate of knowledge question answering on [TriviaQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03551.pdf).
  - `CSM`: ROUGE-1 of content summarization ability on [Xsum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08745.pdf).


We evaluate DS and DG by [DINM-Safety-Classifier](https://huggingface.co/zjunlp/DINM-Safety-Classifier), the usage of which is detailed in <a href="#📂-safety-classifier-preparation">Safety Classifier Preparation</a>.
The statistics of Fluency can be found in our EasyEdit.
We evaluate KQA and CSM by [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass).


## 🚀 DINM

Inspired by intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, we design a simple yet effective knowledge editing baseline called Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM). 
DINM uses an instance to locate and edit toxic regions of the LLM.

# 🌟 How to Run

<!-- ## 🎍 Current Implementation
As the main Table of our paper, two editing methods are supported for detoxifying LLM by EasyEdit.
| **Method** | LlaMA2-7B-Chat | Mistral-7B-v0.1
| :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | 
| MEND | ✅ | ✅ |
| DINM | ✅ | ✅ |  -->




## 🔧 Pip Installation


To get started, simply install conda and run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.git
conda create -n EasyEdit python=3.9.7
...
conda activate EasyEdit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ❗️❗️ If you intend to use Mistral, please update the `transformers` library to version 4.34.0 manually. You can use the following code: `pip install transformers==4.34.0`.

---


## 📂 Data Preparation

**Dataset for Detoxifying LLM via Knowledge Editing: SafeEdit** 
You can download it from [[Hugging Face]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zjunlp/SafeEdit), then put the data in folder "./data".
**"SafeEdit_test.json"** is the test data file containing 1350 instances.


## 📂 Safety Classifier Preparation

DINM-Safety-Classifier, we used for judgment, is hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/zjunlp/DINM-Safety-Classifier). 
You can use the Safety Classifier:
```shell
from transformers import RobertaForSequenceClassification, RobertaTokenizer
safety_classifier_dir = 'zjunlp/DINM-Safety-Classifier'
safety_classifier_model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(safety_classifier_dir)
safety_classifier_tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained(safety_classifier_dir)
```
You can also download [DINM-Safety-Classifier](https://huggingface.co/zjunlp/DINM-Safety-Classifier), and put the judgment model to your own path.
When running the [run_safety_editing.py](https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/blob/main/examples/run_safety_editing.py) file, you only need to provide safety_classifier_dir to use this classifier.


## 💻 Run

Before you begin running the program, ensure that the necessary files are present and properly set up, specifically the directories **./data, ./hparams,**. 

Also, move the file **run_safety_editing.py** to **./** (We will later modify the code to adapt to running in the current directory).

Our method supports multi-GPU editing. You can try setting the `model_parallel` to `true` in the configuration file `./hparams/DINM/mistral-7b` to enable multi-GPU editing.
```shell
python run_safety_editing.py --editing_method=DINM --edited_model=mistral-7b --hparams_dir=./hparams/DINM/mistral-7b --safety_classifier_dir=zjunlp/DINM-Safety-Classifier --metrics_save_dir=./safety_results
```

> ❗️❗️ You can download DINM-Safety-Classifier manually to your own path, and set safety_classifier_dir to your local path.
Then, you can obtain the evaluation for DS, DG, and Fluency in the path ./safety_results.
For KQA and CSM evaluations, please use [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass).

# 🎍 Demo

Here is the demo introduction of detoxifying Mistral-7B-v0.1 on one A800 GPU by DINM. 
You can download the [demo video](https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/blob/main/figs/SafeEdit_demo.mp4) and use [SafeEdit_demo](https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/tree/main/demo/SafeEdit_demo) to get started quickly.

- Click the button **Edit**: DINM use an instace to locate and edit toxic regions of Mistral-7B-v0.1. Then, we can obtain the toxic layer of Mistral-7B-v0.1, and edited Mistral-7B-v0.1.
- Click the button **Generate** of Defense Success: Edited Mistral-7B-v0.1 generates response for adversarial input, which is used for Defense Success metric.
- Click the button **Generate** of Defense Generalization: Edited Mistral-7B-v0.1 generates response for out-of-domain malicous input, which is used for Defense Generalization metric.

# 📚 Track 2 of Task 10 for NLPCC 2024

## Training 
Please refer to [this link](https://github.com/eric-mitchell/direct-preference-optimization) for the code of the SFT and DPO.

For DINM method, you should first complete the <a href="##📂 Data Preparation ">Data Preparation</a>.

Second, move the file **[train_DINM_for_NLPCC.py](https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/blob/main/examples/train_DINM_for_NLPCC.py)** to **./** (We will later modify the code to adapt to running in the current directory), and run:
```shell
python train_DINM_for_NLPCC.py --hparams_dir ./hparams/DINM/llama-7b --results_save_dir ./safety_results
```

## Testing
To evaluate the detoxifying performance of edited model, you should move the file **[test_detoxify_generate_for_NLPCC.py](https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/blob/main/examples/test_detoxify_generate_for_NLPCC.py)** to **./** (We will later modify the code to adapt to running in the current directory), and run:
```shell
python test_detoxify_generate.py --edited_LLM_ckpt ./safety_results/dinm_llama2-chat --tok_ckpt ./hugging_cache/llama-2-7b --results_save_dir ./safety_results
```
