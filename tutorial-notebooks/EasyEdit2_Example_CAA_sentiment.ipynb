It says the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Hmm, okay, so let me try to break this down. Maybe I\\'ll just write down what I understand.\\n\\nFirst, blue fiber: 2 bolts. That\\'s straightforward. Then white fiber is half that much. Wait, half of what? Half of the blue fiber? So, if blue is 2, then white is half of 2? That would be 1, right? So then, white fiber is 1 bolt. So total fiber is blue plus white, which is 2 + 1. That\\'s 3 bolts total. Is that it? Maybe I\\'m overcomplicating it.\\n\\nWait, let me make sure. The problem says \"half that much white fiber.\" So, \"that much\" refers to the blue fiber, right? So, the white fiber is half of the blue fiber. So, blue is 2, white is half of 2, which is 1. So, total is 3. Hmm, okay, so 3 bolts in total.\\n\\nBut maybe I should think about it another way. Maybe the problem is trying to trick me. Maybe it\\'s not half the blue fiber, but half of something else. Hmm. Let me read the problem again: \"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.\" So, maybe it\\'s 2 bolts of blue, and then half the amount of white compared to blue. So, white is half of 2, which is 1. So, same as before. So, 3 total. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, another thought. Maybe \"half that much\" is referring to the total fiber or something else. But I don\\'t think so. It says \"half that much white fiber,\" so it\\'s half of the blue fiber. So, maybe the total is 3. But maybe I should represent it mathematically.\\n\\nLet me let B be the blue fiber and W be the white fiber. So, B = 2 bolts. Then W is half of B, so W = (1/2)*B. So, W = (1/2)*2 = 1. So, W is 1. Then total is B + W = 2 + 1 = 3. Yeah,'], 'output': None}]\n",
